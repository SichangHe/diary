<p>2022-05-15</p>
<p>It is 12 p.m. at night and I'm the only one up at home.
I just had a shower and my hair is still half-dry.
During the shower,
I was thinking and I was feeling lost.
I thought again about my Signature Work,
which does not exist at the moment.</p>
<p>I wrote to a computer science professor for recommendation for mentors.
In that email,
I stated that I wanted to deploy a server with Rust and WASM
but I felt that it would be impossible to accomplish anything alone
and I considered scientific computing as well.
One move I think I did wrong was to mention a project
with another computer science professor,
who the professor I wrote to recommended for mentor without a reason.
I guess they are just pushing me back to whatever I have.</p>
<p>The reason I asked another professor for recommendation for mentors
is right because I sensed that there are something wrong with the way
the current project runs.
I feel like that we are not doing anything special
while getting excited
â€”we are just reinventing the wheel and trying to enjoy it.
Text searching and test processing,
both are something that countless people have done before,
and our team is just importing Python libraries,
smashing it into the project and writing glue code,
and calling it a progress.</p>
<p>A while ago there was a seminar where computer science professors
and students showed what they had done.
All of them used machine learning to treat some problems
that may or may not have any meanings.
I have this impression that people are machines learning for machine learning.
It looks tempting,
but I know that machine learning is extremely data-demanding and therefore hard.
I decided that machine learning would not be a main theme in any research of mine
unless I really have a huge amount of preprocessed data,
which I probably won't have.</p>
<p>I have this feeling that computer science people in DKU tend to play with
little toys that people from a more academic background would discard.
This could be similar for data science people.
I am considering to do some mathematics studiesâ€¦
I thought about it and recall that
my mathematics is a huge pile of mess,
being taking all these &quot;applied&quot; math classes at DKU.
I just took the advanced linear algebra last session
and I had zero motivation to study it along side with CS301
with our lockdown and online classes.
I don't really know what the heck I learned in these courses.
I know they have a lot of proofs that is important,
but I don't really understand why any of them is constructed like that.
I also did horrible in CS301,
which I confirmed today by checking the final exam grade.</p>
<p>I thought to myself that I don't care grades that much.
I figured that I care more about my experiences.
But, I do care about grades.
The way this shows is that bad grades make me visibly unhappy,
and good grades does not make me happy.
It is just poisonous.</p>
<p>I am now thinking that I really should reread the books that I ought to read
but instead attended &quot;slides classes.&quot;
I think learning mathematics is not about taking those freaking classes.
The classes that I did well,
I learned them in advance by book.
I am guessing that I actually learn much less effectively taking classes
than reading books for the following classes.
But, I have been too lazy to read all the books before taking all these classes.
A lot of the time definitely went to YouTube.</p>
<p>Right now,
I'm learning JavaScript,
while also planing for more Rust,
Python,
and C exercises.
But, I suspect that these are not as important as reading more mathematics books for me.
I need to changeâ€¦</p>
